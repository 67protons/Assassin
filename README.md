BatCave Bundle 3 Solo Game

Assassin is a game in Unity3D 5.0 I created over the 2015 Spring Break during my Sophomore year at UC Irvine as part of the VGDC's (Video Game Development Club) BatCave Bundle 3 - a challenge to create a game on one's own in the span of one week.

With the permission of the bundle's project leader, Tyler Nutsathitya, I enlisted the help of my girlfriend, Valerie Herrera, to create the art for Assassin.

I handled all other aspects of the project such as C# scripting, level building, and animations.  I also used open-source songs and sound effects generously provided by Jon Hillman from the Unity Assets store and Sonniss.com respectively.

  -Simple mouse input is used to play the game, and a tutorial is included within the game.
