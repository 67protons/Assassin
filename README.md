# Assassin
BatCave Bundle 3 Solo Game

Assassin is a 2D game I created during the 2015 Spring Break during my Sophomore year at UC Irvine as part of the VGDC's (Video Game Development Club) BatCave Bundle 3 - a challenge to create a game on one's own in the span of one week.

The game was created using Unity 5.0 and the scripts were written in C#.

With the permission of the bundle's project leader, Tyler Nutsathitya, I enlisted the help of my girlfriend, Valerie Herrera, to create the art for Assassin.  I handled all other aspects of the project such as C# scripting, level building, and animations.  I also used open-source songs and sound effects generously provided by Jon Hillman from the Unity Assets store and Sonniss.com respectively.

Assassin was my first dive into sound and animation in Unity.  My goal during the implementation of Assassin was to create as polished and complete of a game that I could, despite the challenge of completing it within a week.

CONTROLS:
Simple mouse input is used to play the game, and a tutorial is included within the game.
